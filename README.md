With this homework I was given the objective to make a responsive portfolio. One page was my Index, another is my portfolio and lastly a contact page. I needed to link all pages so when someone visits the webpage they can go back and forth between the pages without issue. I needed to create a navbar and footer that each page shared. Using bootstrap's grid system I was able to lay out the entire page.
