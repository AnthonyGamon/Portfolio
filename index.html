                 <p>  Hi my name is Anthony and I am currently 23. I am born and raised out of Wichita Kansas.  </p>

                    <p>  I always thought that I would follow my love for social media and sneakers and pursue a career in some form of marketing with a sneaker company. I’ve had the opportunity to work with some amazing brands and started to get a good amount of followers on instagram.</p>

                        <p>I was working to build up my own social media platforms up and creating content I started looking into purchasing a bot to help purchase sneakers and streetwear easier and not have to deal with lines and not getting certain things. I learned very quickly that some of these bots can be pretty expensive.</p>
                        
                        <p>Learning how expensive they could be I started wondering what it would take to actually build a bot and how hard it would be and if this was something I think I could do. After a few months of research and tutorials I started getting more and more interested in what coding was and how I could follow that career path.</p> 
                        
                        <p>After all of that research and thinking one day on a whim I submitted a couple of requests to get bootcamp information and just a few days later I was enrolled and started my pre-work for the KU bootcamp.</p>
                        
                        <p>Once I graduated from the bootcamp I will have learned the following languages and applications HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Express.js, React.js, Node.js, progressive web apps, agile methodology, computer science, MongoDB, MySQL, Git, Python, Java, C#, and Amazon Web Services.</p>
